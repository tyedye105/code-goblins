The Intro

 You were simply entering your username into the computer, when a the webcam at the top of your computer screen started to glow a strange shade of purple.  The light slowly started getting brighter and brighter until it was almost blinding.  Trying to shield your eyes from the bright purple light you bring your hand up to your face, only to find yourself unable to move your hand any further.  Panic starts to overtake you.  You feel the urge to flee, to run away, but you can't move. After a few moments you only see the color purple, the computer lab around is no longer visible.  
  A strange tingling sensation travels through out your body as you are almost deafend from what sounds like the roar of an anceient dial-up modem. This seems to go on for hours, until you feel the senseation of solid ground underneath

The Intro


0.01
 You were simply entering your username into the computer, when a the webcam at the top of your computer screen started to glow a strange shade of purple.  The light slowly started getting brighter and brighter until it was almost blinding.  Trying to shield your eyes from the bright purple light you bring your hand up to your face, only to find yourself unable to move your hand above your chest.  Panic starts to overtake you.  You feel the urge to flee, but you can't move. After a few moments you only see the color purple, the computer lab around is no longer visible.  

0.02
  A strange tingling sensation travels throughout your body as you are almost deafened from what sounds like the roar of an ancient dial-up modem. This seems to go on for hours, until you feel the familiar sensation of solid ground underneath your feet.  Slowly you feel your balance coming back to you as the bright light slowly fades away revealing your surroundings. Your heart skips a beat as you see that you are no longer in the familiar computer lab, that you have come to know as second home.


0.03
  You look at the ground to see what appears to be purple grass, you bend down to pick up a handful.  It feels like grass, it looks like grass, only it's made of endless lines of 1's and 0's constantly shifting around.  There appears to be a large mountain off in the distance, with an imposing castle towering above it.  With no other landmark in sight you start towards walk the castle.  You begin to walk through the grassy plain, until suddenly you can't, as if you have hit am invisible wall. You decided to go another direction until you hit another wall.  You start running in the last directions you haven't tried hoping one of them let you move forward.   Upon hitting the last wall you furiously bang against it and yell up into the black abyss that is the sky above you " WHERE THE HELL AM I?!"


0.04
  "I can answer that."  the voice sounding like one of the earlier text to speech voices. Turning around you see something that is not human by any stretch of the imagination.  A floating purple light that was emitting ghost like trails of 1's and 0's as it floated in front of you. It's only defining feature was the face on the ball of light, it looked liked the primitive smile emoji from the days before the word emoji was even uttered. A colon for the two eyes, and closing bracket for its mouth, yet underneath it was a closing ) and a semicolon.


0.05
  "Greetings, <span>player name</span>.  I know you must be wondering what has happened to you.  It is an ill-fate that has fallen upon you, as the poor coders that have come and gone before you. You have torn away from your world, and into the realm of code goblins, nefarious, often harmless creatures. Yet they have united under the banner of the Code Goblin King, and have begun to abduct coders from all across the world. You are lucky, normally there is a goblin waiting to knock it's abductee and drag them into the depths of the King's directories.
Just as the ball finishes speaking there is a bright purple light in the distance, like a bolt of lighting the strikes the ground.  


0.06  
The emoji ball flips so that semicolon and the ) form a frowning face.
  "I spoke too soon.  <span> Player </span> one of the king's goblins is coming for you, take a hold of this!"
In front of the emoji a $ sign appears before you.
  "Take up the mighty $, it will allow you to tap into the command line. Your greatest tool, and your greatest weapon, if you hope to return back home."


  Alert(“do you take the $ sign?”)


  If Player declines the $  Then


Game over


You declined to take the one item that would allow you to go back home.  The emoji disappears as mysteriously as it appeared, and you are knocked unconscious by the code goblin. When you come too, you find yourself locked in holding cells of the King until the end of your days.


  If Player accepts $ Then


0.07
  "That's the spirit, you are met with a challenge, rise up to it code-warrior. "


  You touch dollar sign and you feel a surge of power, but unlike the your previous energies, you feel stronger, ready to defeat you goblin adversary.  You look above you to see there is a block of text floating above you. It says your name, followed by a blinking $.


  "Get ready the goblin is here!" the emoji possibly shouted, you can't tell, for it has the emotional depth of a 2d plane.


  The goblin pulls out a large club, standing menacing, just as ugly as the goblins from any Dungeons and Dragons campaign, but you have no weapons. How did the emoji expect you to fight?  Without warning the goblin charges!


  "Type in dfnd self in the command line to defend yourself from the goblin's attack, just start typing in the air!"


  Player types in “dfnd self”










0.08
You start air typing in front of you, and keyboard materializes out of the purple either for you to type on, the goblin now moving in slow motion.  Listening to the emoji's words, you type in the command as fast as you can, and hit enter.


Suddenly the goblin is charging towards you at full speed, and as he swing at you the keyboard that was in front of you morphs into a large floating shield.


"Good, you have him off balance. Attack him with atk goblin!"


Player types “atk goblin”


0.09
Again you start typing in the air and the shield forms back into the ethereal keyboard.  With the last keystroke of the command the keyboard transforms into a sword, and dices the goblin in half.  It's body falling to the ground before dissipating in a cloud of 1's and 0's




"Well done Code-warrior <span> Player Name</span>! Perhaps you might be the one to defeat the King Goblin, and release the poor coders he has held captive! To the castle"  You stare dumbfounded at the emoji. The two of you stand silently for minutes before the emoji speaks up. "Ahh you must be wondering how to get to that damned castle anyways.  Like I said the command line is not your greatest weapon, but it is also your greatest tool.  Type in “cd gk_entrance” and we will travel to top directory of the King's castle.  Don't worry about leaving me behind. I will be traveling with you, I am the Unexpected token. They will not expect me."


0.10
You type in the command, and watch as the cmd line floating above you populates the textbox as you type.   In a flash of purple light you are wiser from your current location, and flung through the ether between 1’s and 0’s.  When you are back on the ground you look around to see you are no longer in the grassy plain, but in a room with four cobblestone walls. Everything made of 1’s and 0’s, like the grass you had encountered before.  Before you is a giant door, that appeared to have been long forgotten as it appeared that dust had settled all around the room.
0.11
“This is a secret entrance into the King’s store room.  When he rose to power, everything that was not relevant to him was through into hundreds of directories and sealed away down here.  Little does he know by doing so he has unwittingly given those who choose to stand against him a chance into his castle. However here you will need to rely on your ability to use the command line to look for, and interact things you might find useful.  Type in ls and you will see everything that will be of use to you. “


You follow the emoji’s advice and type in the command, and immediate your eye is drawn to a box that now glew a bright shade of purple.  The box labeled junk. Without a second thought you walk up to the box and try to open it, only to receive a sharp jolt. Of pain through your body.


0.12
“As you have experienced, only the goblins themselves are able to dig through the directories.  However, you have the power of the command line at your… command… cd can not only transport to different places, but it can also open containers, and let you look at its contents, even take the contents of the box with you.  Give it a try”




Player inputs “cd junk”


0.13
The box opens up, but all you see is a jumbled mess of 1’s and 0’s.




Player types in
“ls”

0.15
“Good you found the key, just type in gt key and you will pick it up.”


0.16
Player types in “gt key”


0.17
As the emoji said, so it did.
"When you are done messing around be sure to use cd .. to reset the scope of the command line! Otherwise this place will become your tomb! Now let us begin the true journey. To use the item type in the object.item! "


Player type “itm door.key”




The door disappears and reveals a words.  gk-storage521

 With every use of the command line, you feel yourself becoming more accustomed to the how the world works.  You find yourself in another cobblestone room, you look around to see there is nothing on the ground except for a giant box that has the faded word "door" on it. You look up to the ceiling and you hundreds if not thousands of boxes floating above you out of reach. Then you notice that something is missing.  The emoji!  Unexpected Token is no longer at your side.  Perhaps the emoji will find you in the next directory, until then, all you have to rely on is your own wits.

Your pulse quickens as objects come into very,  A a code goblin, riding atop a vicious looking worm. Definitely not the emoji you expected. You close the directory as quickly as you hoping the act of closing the directory would keep the two of them trapped.

In a now familiar flash of energy you are whisked away from the room of a thousand directories into a dark ominous room.  You can’t see anything, yet there is a deep sense of foreboding that you can’t shake.  Then from the darkness comes a sinister voice.


“So you have finally made it.  You are different than most of the wanna be code-monkeys my subjects collect.  To have made it this far you must somewhat competent.”

The Intro

 You were simply entering your username into the computer, when a the webcam at the top of your computer screen started to glow a strange shade of purple.  The light slowly started getting brighter and brighter until it was almost blinding.  Trying to shield your eyes from the bright purple light you bring your hand up to your face, only to find yourself unable to move your hand any further.  Panic starts to overtake you.  You feel the urge to flee, to run away, but you can't move. After a few moments you only see the color purple, the computer lab around is no longer visible.  
  A strange tingling sensation travels through out your body as you are almost deafend from what sounds like the roar of an anceient dial-up modem. This seems to go on for hours, until you feel the senseation of solid ground underneath.  Slowly you feel your balance coming back to you as the bright light slowly fades away revealing your surroundings. Your heart skips a beat as you see that you are no longer in the familar computer lab you have come to call home away from home.

  YOu look at the ground to see what appears to be purple grass, you bend down to pick up a handful.  It feels like grass, it looks like grass, only its made of endless lines of 1's and 0's constantly shifting around.  There appears to be a large mountain off in the distance, with an imposing castle.  With no other landmark in sight you start to walk the castle.  You begin to walk through the grassy plain, until suddenly you cant.  It is if you have hit a invisible wall that wont allow you to go further, so you decided to go another direction until you hit another wall.  You start running in the last directions you haven't tried hoping one of them let you move forward.   Upon hitting the last wall you furiously bang against it and yell up into the black abyss that is the sky above you " WHERE THE HELL AM I?!"

  "I can answer that."  the voice sounding like one of the earlier text to speech voices. Turning around you see something that is not human by any stretch of the imagiation.  A floating purple light that was emitting ghost like trails of 1's and 0's as it floated in front of you. It's only defining feature was the face on the ball of light, it looked liked the primitive smile emoji from the days before the word emoji was even uttered. A colon for the two eyes, and closing bracket for its mouth, yet underneath it was a closingp ) and a semicolon.

  "Greetings, <span>player name</span>.  I know you must be wondering what has happened to you.  It is an ill-fate that has fallen upon you, as the poor coders that have come and gone before you. You have torn away from your world, and into the realm of code goblins, nefarious, often harmless creatures. Yet they have united under the banner of the Code Goblin King, and have begun to abduct coders from all across the world. You are lucky, normally there is a goblin waiting to knock it's abudctee and drag them into the depths of the King's directories.

  Just as the ball finishes speaking there is a bright purple light in the distance, like a bolt of lighting the strikes the ground.  
  The emoji ball flips so that semicolon and the ) form a frowning face.
  "I spoke too soon.  <span> Player </span> one of the king's goblins is coming for you, take a hold of this!"

  Infront of the emoji a $ sigh appears before you.

  "Take up the mighty $, it will allow you to tap into the command line. Your greatest tool, and your greatest weapon, if you hope to return back home."

  CHOICE TIMe

  Player declines the $

  Then

Game over

You declined to take the one item that would allow you to go back home.  The emoji dissapaers as mystersiously as it appeared, and you are knocked unconsious by the code goblin. When you come too, you find yourself locked in holding cells of the King until the end of your days.

  Player accepts $

  "That's the spirit, you are met with a challange, rise up to it code warrior. "

  You touch dollar sign and you feel a surge of power, but unlike the your previous energies, you feel stronger, ready to defeat you goblin adversary.  You look above you to see there is a block of text floating above you. It says your name, followed by a blinking $.

  "Get ready the goblin is here!" the emoji possibly shouted, you can't tell, for it has the emotional depth of a 2d plane.

  The goblin pulls out a large club, standing menancing, just as ugly as the goblins from any Dungeons and Dragons campaign, but you have no weapons. How did the emoji expect you to fight?  Withouth warning the goblin charges!

  "Type in dfnd self in the command line to defend yourself from the goblin's attack, just start typing in the air!"

  ex.

  $playername dfnd self

You start air typing in front of you, and keyboard materializes out of the purple either for you to type on, the goblin now moving in slow motion.  Listening to the emoji's words, you type in the command as fast as you can, and hit enter.

Suddnely the goblin is charging towards you at full speed, and as he swing at you the keyboard that was infront of you morphs into a large floating shield.

"Good, you have him off balance. Attack him with atk goblin!"

Again you start typing in the air and the sheild forms back into the ethereal keyboard.  With the last keystroke of the command the keyboard transforms into a sword, and dices the goblin in half.  It's body falling to the ground before dissapiting in a cloud of 1's and 0's


"Well done Code Warrior <span> Player Name</span>! Perhaps you might be the one to defeat the King Goblin, and release the poor coders he has held captive! To the castle"  You stare dumbfounded at the emoji. The two of you stand silently for minutes before the emoji speaks up. "Ahh you must be wondering how to get to that damned castle anyways.  Like I said the command line is not your greatest weapon, but it is also your greatest tool.  Type in CD gk_entrance and we will travel to top directory of the King's castle.  Don't worry about leaving me behind. I will be traveling with you, I am the Unexpected token. They will not expect me."

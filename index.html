            <p id= "n1">You were simply entering your username into the computer, when a the webcam at the top of your computer screen started to glow a strange shade of purple.  The light slowly started getting brighter and brighter until it was almost blinding.  Trying to shield your eyes from the bright purple light you bring your hand up to your face, only to find yourself unable to move your hand above your chest.  Panic starts to overtake you.  You feel the urge to flee, but you can't move. After a few moments you only see the color purple, the computer lab around is no longer visible.</p>

            <p id= "n2">A strange tingling sensation travels throughout your body as you are almost deafened from what sounds like the roar of an ancient dial-up modem. This seems to go on for hours, until you feel the familiar sensation of solid ground underneath your feet.  Slowly you feel your balance coming back to you as the bright light slowly fades away revealing your surroundings. Your heart skips a beat as you see that you are no longer in the familiar computer lab, that you have come to know as second home.</p>

            <p id= "n3">You look at the ground to see what appears to be purple grass, you bend down to pick up a handful.  It feels like grass, it looks like grass, only it's made of endless lines of 1's and 0's constantly shifting around.  There appears to be a large mountain off in the distance, with an imposing castle towering above it.  With no other landmark in sight you start towards walk the castle.  You begin to walk through the grassy plain, until suddenly you can't, as if you have hit am invisible wall. You decided to go another direction until you hit another wall.  You start running in the last directions you haven't tried hoping one of them let you move forward.   Upon hitting the last wall you furiously bang against it and yell up into the black abyss that is the sky above you -- <br>
             <span class= "player">"WHERE THE HELL AM I?!"</span></p>

            <p id= "n4"><span class= "emoji">"I can answer that."</span><br><br> Turning around, you see something that is not human by any stretch of the imagination.  A floating purple light that was emitting ghost like trails of 1's and 0's as it floated in front of you. It's only defining feature was the face on the ball of light, it looked liked the primitive smile emoji from the days before the word emoji was even uttered. A colon for the two eyes, and closing bracket for its mouth, yet underneath it was a closing ) and a semicolon.</p>

            <p id= "n5"><span class ="emoji">"Greetings, <span class= "name"></span>.  I know you must be wondering what has happened to you.  It is an ill-fate that has fallen upon you, as the poor coders that have come and gone before you. You have torn away from your world, and into the realm of code goblins, nefarious, often harmless creatures. Yet they have united under the banner of the Code Goblin King, and have begun to abduct coders from all across the world. You are lucky, normally there is a goblin waiting to knock it's abductee and drag them into the depths of the King's directories."</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Just as the ball finishes speaking there is a bright purple light in the distance, like a bolt of lighting the strikes the ground.
            </p>

            <p id ="n6">The emoji ball flips so that semicolon and the ) form a frowning face.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class= "emoji">"I spoke too soon, <span class="name"> </span>. One of the king's goblins is coming for you, take a hold of this!"</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            In front of the emoji a $ sign appears before you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="emoji">"Take up the mighty $, it will allow you to tap into the command line. Your greatest tool, and your greatest weapon, if you hope to return back home."</span>
            </p>

            <h1 id= "dlr">$</h1>

            <p id= "dollar" class= "emoji"> “do you take the $ sign?”
            </p>

            <p id ="n7"><span class="emoji" >"That's the spirit, you are met with a challenge, rise up to it code-warrior."</span>

          <div id="intro-stay">
            <br>
            <br>
            You touch dollar sign and you feel a surge of power, but unlike the your previous energies, you feel stronger, ready to defeat you goblin adversary.  You look above you to see there is a block of text floating above you. It says your name, followed by a blinking $.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="emoji">"Get ready the goblin is here!" the emoji possibly shouted, you can't tell, for it has the emotional depth of a 2d plane.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            The goblin pulls out a large club, standing menacing, just as ugly as the goblins from any Dungeons and Dragons campaign, but you have no weapons. How did the emoji expect you to fight?  Without warning the goblin charges!
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class= "emoji">"Type "dfnd self in the command line to defend yourself from the goblin's attack, just start typing in the air!"</span>

<!-- Ending if player declines $ -->
        <div id="lose1">
          <p>You declined to take the one item that would allow you to go back home.  The emoji disappears as mysteriously as it appeared, and you are knocked unconscious by the code goblin. When you come too, you find yourself locked in holding cells of the King until the end of your days.</p>
